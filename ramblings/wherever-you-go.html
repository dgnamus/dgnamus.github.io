        <p>It was a few years ago when I visited Vienna. I was never there before and I thought it would be great fun. I
            was single at the time and fairly unhappy with my job and how my life has been going to that point. I
            thought that to go to a new city would refresh me, give me new perspective, make me a new person in a sense.
            I had a feeling it would be like walking aimlessly in the jungle and then finding a path to the top of the
            tree and seeing where the Lonely Mountain is (reference from Hobbit; the mountain is the expeditions goal).
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, looking back now, my expectations were way too high. There is a sense that we can escape from
            ourselves, from our everyday life. I think we hope that a sort of our dormant-self will come out since it
            will now have the chance. The routine and monotony of our workdays suppresses us, tramples our "true" selves
            and we need this sort of escape to allow it to come back forth. Right?
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe that is a case for some. My belief is that people, who "shine" in those sort of escapisms, did not
            have their spirit trampled in their everyday lives in the first place (which is really good). In these kind
            of escapes, they can just explore the expansion of space around them. It's someone, figuratively speaking,
            who has been looking out of a huge window for the whole sunny day and the door now opened for them to go
            outside. They already explored in their mind what they want to do, they imagined it by that point, but they
            were still in the contact with the world they imagined themselves in (by looking through the window).
        </p>
        <p>What happens to a person who was in the windowless room before that (even if by their own design)? This is
            the comparison I found myself in. Coming to Vienna by myself, this behemoth of a historical city, was quite
            an anxious experience. What does one do? Going through the routine of everyday life, staying in a pretty
            small habitat of going to work, going home, going to the store, occasional coffee, a walk, a bicycle ride.
            How do you cope with this new reality of everything being unknown and, on top of that, 1000x larger than
            your previous habitat? By all understanding I had up to that point, I should feel free beyond everything
            what my everyday life was offering me, but there I was, feeling crippled with choice. I took myself with me.
            I took with myself the perceptions of my boundaries, and by those boundaries disappearing, felt lost in
            space.</p>
        <p>
            I quite enjoyed Vienna all in all. I extended my initial 3 days to 5 days. But the biggest thing I took back
            were not pictures, nor the Mozartkugeln, nor the awe of this grand city. It was an essential understanding
            that wherever you go, you take yourself with you. Yourself doesn't patiently wait for you at home. So I
            derive from this that every travel of yours has already started, even if you did not even start to plan it.
            Maybe you do not even have an idea yet (and we have corona now anyway, so you might have to wait a little
            while more). But it has already started. Make it enjoyable.
